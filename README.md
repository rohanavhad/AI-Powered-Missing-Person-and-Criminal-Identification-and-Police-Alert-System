# üìå AI-Powered Missing Person and Criminal Identification & Police Alert System

## üîç Overview
This cutting-edge platform uses **real-time facial recognition technology** to identify missing persons and criminal suspects from video feeds across multiple locations. When a match is found, the system immediately alerts relevant authorities via SMS, potentially saving crucial time in locating individuals of interest.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Advanced Facial Recognition** - Deep learning algorithms identify individuals by comparing video feed faces against our secure database
- **Multi-Location Monitoring** - Process simultaneous video streams from various locations for comprehensive coverage
- **Instant SMS Notifications** - Location-specific alerts sent to authorities when matches are detected via Twilio API
- **Comprehensive Logging** - Detailed records of all detections including images, timestamps, and location data
- **Secure Admin Dashboard** - Protected interface for system management, record updates, and detection monitoring
- **Centralized Database** - Secure storage for facial encodings, personal information, and all system activities

3. **Video Feed Monitoring**  
   ![Live Monitoring Interface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8c7761b-26b2-4d79-936b-495ba10cb02e)

4. **Facial Recognition Processing**  
   System continuously analyzes frames for potential matches

5. **Alert Generation**  
   When matches are found:
   - Event is logged in the database
   - SMS alert is dispatched to nearest authorized contact
   - Detection appears on the dashboard
